In a seemingly technologically deterministic world, it feels like new discoveries and innovations in the field of technology are made everyday. With the exceedingly fast pace these advancements are coming, we can see how our society is evolving. However, without stopping and thinking about the implications, creators of tech are in danger of ignoring important social groups that do not have a contributing role in creating new technology.
In our group we discussed _technological equality_ and how sometimes technology favors some groups while ignoring other groups completely.
One of these groups that has been "left behind" is the elderly population. This user group faces many challenges that can be eased or eradicated completely with technology, however they are often ignored and deemed "not tech savy."

Dementia, or memory loss is a huge problem that many individuals in this user group face. Several members in our group have family members suffering with dementia and have witnessed some challenges that it brings to everyday lives. We believe that technology is a great tool to ease the emotional stress/ burdens the effects of this condition bring to both the individual and their families.

For our project, we chose to tackle three main problems people with dementia face:
1. Remembering when to eat/ if they ate
2. Remembering if they took medications
3. Remembering family members

Keeping these in mind, we set off to create an easy to use, easy to learn application that will positively impact the lives of people like my grandpa everyday. DementiAid.

Today we designed and created mockups for all the features in DementiAid but only focused on two features to code. These two features are keeping track of the meals an individual has eaten in a day and keeping track if they have taken their medication.
